# TRADES (**TR**adeoff-inspired **A**dversarial **DE**fense via **S**urrogate-loss minimization) 

This is the code for the paper "Theoretically Principled Trade-off between Robustness and Accuracy" by Hongyang Zhang (CMU), Yaodong Yu (University of Virginia), Jiantao Jiao (UC Berkeley), Eric P. Xing (CMU & Petuum Inc.), Laurent El Ghaoui (UC Berkeley), and Michael I. Jordan (UC Berkeley).

The methodology is the winner of the NeurIPS 2018 Adversarial Vision Challenge (Robust Model Track).

The code is written in python and requires numpy, matplotlib, torch, torchvision and the tqdm library.

## Install
This code depends on python 3.6, pytorch 0.4.1. We suggest to install the dependencies using Anaconda or Miniconda. Here is an exemplary command:
```
$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.1.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
$ bash Anaconda3-5.1.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
$ source ~/.bashrc
$ conda install pytorch=0.4.1
```

## Prerequisites
* Python (3.6.4)
* Pytorch (0.4.1)
* CUDA
* numpy


## TRADES: A New Loss Function for Adversarial Training

### What is TRADES?
TRADES minimizes a regularized surrogate loss L(.,.) (e.g., the cross-entropy loss) for adversarial training:
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\min_f\mathbb{E}\left\\{\mathcal{L}(f(X),Y)+\beta\max_{X'\in\mathbb{B}(X,\epsilon)}\mathcal{L}(f(X),f(X'))\right\\})

The first term encourages the natural error to be optimized by minimizing the "difference" between f(X) and Y , while the second regularization term encourages the output to be smooth, that is, it pushes the decision boundary of classifier away from the sample instances via minimizing the "difference" between the prediction of natural example f(X) and that of adversarial example f(X′). The tuning parameter β plays a critical role on balancing the importance of natural and robust errors.

## How to apply our new loss, TRADES, to train robust models?

### Natural training:
```python
def train(args, model, device, train_loader, optimizer, epoch):
    model.train()
    for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
        data, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data)
        loss = F.nll_loss(output, target)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```
### Adversarial training by TRADES:
To apply TRADES, cd into the directory, put 'trades.py' to the directory. Just need to modify the above code as follows:
```python
from trades import trades_loss

def train(args, model, device, train_loader, optimizer, epoch):
    model.train()
    for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
        data, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        # calculate robust loss - TRADES loss
        loss = trades_loss(model=model,
                           x_natural=data,
                           y=target,
                           optimizer=optimizer,
                           step_size=args.step_size,
                           epsilon=args.epsilon,
                           perturb_steps=args.num_steps,
                           batch_size=args.batch_size,
                           beta=args.beta)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```
#### Arguments:
* ```step_size```: step size for perturbation
* ```epsilon```: limit on the perturbation size
* ```num_steps```: number of perturbation iterations for projected gradient descent (PGD)
* ```batch_size```: batch size for training
* ```beta```: trade-off regularization parameter.

The trade-off regularization parameter ```beta``` can be set in ```[1, 10]```. Larger ```beta``` leads to more robust and less accurate models.

### Basic MNIST example (adversarial training by TRADES):
```python
python mnist_example_trades.py
```
We adopt ```main.py``` in [[link]](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/mnist) and apply our new loss ```trades_loss()``` during training.



## Running demos

### Adversarial training:

* Train WideResNet-34-10 model on CIFAR10:
```bash
  $ python train_trades_cifar10.py
```

## Want to attack TRADES? No problem!

TRADES is a new baseline method for adversarial defenses. We welcome various attack methods to attack our defense models. We provide checkpoints of our robust models on MNIST dataset and CIFAR dataset. On both datasets, we normalize all the images to ```[0, 1]```.

### Load our CNN model for MNIST
```python
from models.small_cnn import SmallCNN

device = torch.device("cuda")
model = SmallCNN().to(device)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('./checkpoints/model_mnist_smallcnn.pt'))
```
For our model ```model_mnist_smallcnn.pt```, the limit on the perturbation size is ```epsilon=0.3``` (L_infinity perturbation distance).
